### Installing Dependencies#
----

This project relies on the [OWL API](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cnet.sourceforge.owlapi%7Cowlapi-distribution%7C4.2.5%7Cbundle) which has a series of dependencies. Though not required, using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) to install the required dependencies is highly recommended. Simply [follow the install instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) (Homebrew can also be used on OS X with the command `brew install maven`), then navigate to the TextAnalysis directory and execute the command `mvn clean install`.
