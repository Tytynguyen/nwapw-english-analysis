ontology: homrel
remark: The idea is that we can declare a relation homeomorphic for a particular class; e.g. part_of is homeomorphic for continuants and processes. this means that parthood relations are always continuant-continuant or process-process, never continuant-process. note that this isn't possible with ordinary domain/range constraints without making sub-relations for part_of
