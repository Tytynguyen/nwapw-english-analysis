[Term]
id: GO:0009579
name: thylakoid
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A membranous cellular structure that bears the photosynthetic pigments in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. In cyanobacteria thylakoids are of various shapes and are attached to, or continuous with, the plasma membrane. In eukaryotes they are flattened, membrane-bounded disk-like structures located in the chloroplasts; in the chloroplasts of higher plants the thylakoids form dense stacks called grana. Isolated thylakoid preparations can carry out photosynthetic electron transport and the associated phosphorylation." [GOC:ds, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0198506732 "Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"]
comment: A thylakoid is not considered an organelle, but some thylakoids are part of organelles.

name: response to biotic stimulus
namespace: biological_process
def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a biotic stimulus, a stimulus caused or produced by a living organism." [GOC:hb]
comment: Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Annotations to this term will be removed during annotation QC.
