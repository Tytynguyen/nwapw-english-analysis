def: "An amyloid beta A4 protein (human) that has at least one amino acid residue that differs from the corresponding residue found in another amyloid beta A4 protein (human) when such a difference arises as the result of genetic differences, i.e., different alleles of amyloid beta A4 protein (human). Operationally, this means the sequence representation of the amyloid beta A4 protein (human) has at least one amino acid residue that differs from the corresponding residue found in the sequence representation given by UniProtKB:P05067-1."

comment: The signal peptide can be cleaved either co- or post-translationally. For this reason, we do not use the derives_from relation when defining protein forms lacking the signal peptide (because the precursor form might not yet exist at the time of removal).

comment: Down-propagates. The original name for this in the paper is 'specific_to'. Applicable to genes because some genes are lost in sub-species (strains) of a species.
