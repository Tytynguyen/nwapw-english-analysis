name: lamina monopolar neuron L1
def: "A lamina monopolar neuron with short collaterals that project radially from the main projection in the lamina (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989). These short collaterals are postsynaptic to the terminals of photoreceptors R1-6 (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991). It arborizes in medulla layers M1 and M5. In the medulla, it receives synaptic input from photoreceptor R8 (in M1), makes reciprocal synaptic connections with monopolar lamina cell L5 and centrifugal neuron C2, and makes presynaptic contacts with centrifugal neuron C3 (Takemura et al., 2008)." [FlyBase:FBrf0049410, FlyBase:FBrf0054529, FlyBase:FBrf0205531]
comment: Connectivity in the lamina is extrapolated from serial EM of a single column (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991). Connectivity in the medulla is extrapolated from serial EM of 3 columns from a single sample (Takemura et al., 2008).

def: "An eye photoreceptor cell whose rhabdomere is part of the outer trapezoid of rhabdomeres of each ommatidium. There are six of these per ommatidium. Each has a single axon that projects along a single lamina optic cartridge within which it makes extensive synaptic connections before terminating in the proximal lamina. This axon is presynaptic to lamina monopolar cells L1, L2 and L3 (at tetrad synapses), but also postsynaptic at (dyad) feedback synapses from L2 and L4 (Meinertzhagen and O'Neil, 1991)."
