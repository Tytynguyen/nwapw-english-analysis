 * Test cases for rendering of disjoint axioms. The OWL 1.1 specification makes
 * it possible to specify that a set of classes are mutually disjoint.
 * Unfortunately, this must be represented in RDF as a set of pairwise disjoint
 * statements. In otherwords, DisjointClasses(A, B, C) must be represented as
 * DisjointWith(A, B), DisjointWith(A, C) DisjointWith(B, C). ~This test case
 * ensure that these axioms are serialsed correctly.
