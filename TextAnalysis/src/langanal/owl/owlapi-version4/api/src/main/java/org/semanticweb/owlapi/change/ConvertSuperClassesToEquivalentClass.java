/**
 * This composite change will convert a primitive class to a defined class by
 * replacing subclass axioms where the class in question is on the left hand
 * side of the subclass axiom to an equivalent classes axiom which makes the
 * class equivalent to the intersection of its superclasses. <br>
 * More formally, given a class A, a set of ontologies S, and a target
 * targetOntology T, for each targetOntology O in S, subclass axioms whose LHS
 * is A will be removed from O. The superclasses from these axioms will be
 * combined into an intersection class which will be made equivalent to A using
 * an equivalent classes axioms E. E will be added to the target targetOntology
 * T.<br>
 * This composite change supports the pattern of working where a primitive class
 * is converted to a defined class - functionality which is usually found in
 * editors.
